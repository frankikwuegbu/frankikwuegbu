## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Frank
I am a Computer Science graduate.<br />
I love Networking. The one with the switches and routers, not the talking to people one lol.
My github account is dedicated to storing my projects some of which are broken on purpose so feel free to fix them.<br />
I love cloud, to be honest i just started so, i think i love cloud, i want to love cloud lol.<br />
I love learning and i realize that is a never ending journey especially in the field i have decided to enter.<br />
If you love the things i do, let's learn together!
